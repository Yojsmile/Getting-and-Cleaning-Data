## Description on how the script works
1. Download the data source and put into a folder on your local working directory. You'll have a UCI HAR Dataset folder.
2. Make sure you have installed the "reshape2" and "data.table" packages. 
3. Put run_analysis.R in the directory where UCI HAR Dataset folder is located. Set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
4. Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file tiny_data.txt in your working directory.
